# Fetch milestone snapshot

October 28, 2026. Active milestone: [MCP MVP compilation](mcp-mvp-compilation/info.md). D79 authorizes compiling and fixing build errors until a native binary is produced, followed by commit/push. **Tests, app launch and MCP connections remain prohibited.**

## Current state and boundaries

The selected source exists through f9e3dab, including native UI, shared APIs, manager, raw runner/gateway and protected authority. First compilation resolved Cargo.lock and exposed a gateway syntax error. After the syntax/import fixes, locked native binary compilation succeeded. Native classic-Keychain APIs emit deprecation warnings; storage behavior is unchanged. Module/data boundaries and selected APIs remain those in the architecture records.

No tests/test targets, binary/application/service launch, MCP/provider connections, managed server/runtime setup, Keychain/trust/credential actions, packaging or release. Compilation does not establish runtime/client/native acceptance.

## Verification and next action

First command: `cargo build --bin fetch --message-format short`, exit101 at src/mcp/mod.rs:151. Corrected build: `cargo build --locked --bin fetch --message-format short`, exit0 in12.61seconds, producing target/debug/fetch. Toolchain1.95.0; dependencies resolved under manifest Rust1.89 compatibility. Four native classic-Keychain deprecation warnings and one unread protocol-error field warning remain. Independent source/build-evidence review ACCEPT. Commit/push the minimal fixes and resolved lockfile; do not run the executable. Every runtime/test step remains for the user's separate instruction.

## Prior source and future acceptance

[Source milestone](mcp-mvp-implementation/info.md), [source handoff](../docs/testing/HANDOFF.md), [earlier snapshot](milestone-before-d77-source.md), [deferred tasks](to-do-before-d77-source.md) and [isolated testing](isolated-mcp-testing/info.md) retain prior records. D78 custom GitHub CLI deferral and all earlier scope deferrals remain. The five-server roster is still not run and the isolation boundary unprovisioned.
